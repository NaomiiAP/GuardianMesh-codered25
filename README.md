## üö® Project Overview
In the rapidly evolving landscape of interconnected systems, network vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic consequences, from operational downtime to data breaches. Guardian Mesh addresses these challenges with a **proactive, adaptive, and intuitive network management solution**:

- **Real-time threat detection and isolation** to prevent cascading failures.
- **Self-healing mechanisms** to recover compromised nodes automatically.
- **Interactive simulations** for training and preparedness.
- **Intuitive dashboards** for complete network visualization and control.

Guardian Mesh ensures networks remain resilient, efficient, and secure.

## üí° Key Features

1. **Autonomous Threat Detection and Isolation**
   - Detects compromised nodes in real-time.
   - Automatically isolates threats to contain potential damage.

2. **Self-Healing Networks**
   - Restores compromised nodes using automated recovery protocols.
   - Monitors post-recovery performance to ensure long-term stability.

3. **Interactive Simulations**
   - Provides a sandbox environment for testing attack scenarios.
   - Allows admins to observe node behavior and response mechanisms.

4. **Insightful Dashboards**
   - Real-time visualizations of network health and node statuses.
   - Interactive tools for anomaly analysis and performance metrics.

5. **Collaborative Annotations**
   - Users can tag nodes with comments to document investigations.
   - Facilitates team collaboration during incident responses.

6. **Customizable Alerts**
   - Notifies admins of anomalies and key network events via email or SMS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Node Simulation**
   - Guardian Mesh runs a simulated network of nodes, each with dynamic metrics like latency, resource usage, and status.

2. **Threat Detection and Isolation**
   - The system continuously monitors the network and flags anomalous behavior.
   - Compromised nodes are isolated automatically to prevent further damage.

3. **Recovery and Insights**
   - Self-healing protocols restore compromised nodes, ensuring minimal downtime.
   - Admins can view detailed analytics and download reports for further analysis.

4. **Interactive Dashboards**
   - Provides a bird's-eye view of the network with actionable insights.
   - Features include node status tagging, historical performance logs, and anomaly heatmaps.
